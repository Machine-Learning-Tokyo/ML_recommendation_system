# ML_recommendation_system

We are looking to curate high quality Machine Learning resources for building a ML recommendation system. We have 3 major categories:

- (1) MATH
- (2) CODE
- (3) RESEARCH PAPERS

Each resource for each category has several different tags, depending on its content. Thank you for your help!
